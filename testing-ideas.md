Menu Panel Rendering: Since you have a MenuPanel component, you can test different aspects of it:

Ensure the menu panel renders correctly without any errors.
Check if the default props or initial state render the expected UI elements.
Ensure any buttons, dropdowns, or other selectable items are present.
Player Selection:

Verify that players can select their mark (X or O).
Test the UI behavior when a mark is selected (does something highlight? does a button become active?).
Game State Changes:

Verify that the game state changes appropriately when a move is made.
Ensure the game recognizes a win condition.
Check for a draw or tie condition when the board fills up without a winner.
Board Rendering:

Ensure the tic-tac-toe board renders correctly.
Check that a move is displayed on the board when a player selects a cell.
Ensure the board updates correctly for each successive move.
Player Turn Handling:

Test that turns alternate between Player 1 and Player 2.
Ensure the UI reflects whose turn it currently is.
Endgame Scenarios:

Check that the game ends when there's a winning row, column, or diagonal.
Verify the game ends in a draw if the board is filled without a winner.
Ensure the appropriate win or draw message is displayed.
Responsive Behavior (if applicable):

Ensure the game board and UI elements are responsive and look good on different screen sizes, especially if you're using Bootstrap or other responsive frameworks.
Interaction with External Libraries:

If you're integrating with external libraries like react-bootstrap, ensure components from those libraries render and behave correctly within your app.
Reset or New Game:

If you have a reset or new game feature, test that it clears the board and resets the game state.
Error Handling:

Test any error messages or fallback UI elements you've implemented for unexpected scenarios.
This list should give you a good starting point for testing. Once you've covered these, you can also think about edge cases or any other specific features you've implemented in your tic-tac-toe game.
